{-| This module implements the core "trick" of StrictCheck: observing the
    demand behavior of a function in a purely functional way.

    All the functions in this module are safe and referentially transparent.

    Observing the evaluation of a function using these functions incurs at most
    a small constant multiple of overhead compared to just executing the function
    with no observation.

-- * of a given __unary function__,
-- * called upon a given input,
--
-- returning a pair of
--
-- * the demand on its output exerted by the evaluation context, and
-- * the demand on its input this induced
--
-- Suppose we want to see how strict @reverse@ is when we evaluate its result
-- to weak-head normal form:
--
-- >>> (b, a) = observe1 (`seq` ()) (reverse @Int) [1, 2, 3]
-- >>> printDemand b  -- output demand
-- _ : _
-- >>> printDemand a  -- input demand
-- _ : _ : _ : _ : []
--
-- This tells us that our context did indeed evaluate the result of @reverse@
-- to force only its first constructor, and that doing so required the entire
-- spine of the list to be evaluated, but did not evaluate any of its elements.
